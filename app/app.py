Here is an example of a Python Flask API code that can be used to implement the Streamlined Document Verification user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data for loan application and associated documents
loan_application = {
    "applicant_id": 12345,
    "documents": {
        "identification": "ID123",
        "proof_of_income": "POI456",
        "credit_history": "CH789",
        "employment_details": "ED012"
    }
}

# API endpoint for retrieving loan application and associated documents
@app.route("/loan_application/<int:applicant_id>", methods=["GET"])
def get_loan_application(applicant_id):
    if applicant_id == loan_application["applicant_id"]:
        return jsonify(loan_application)
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Loan application not found"}), 404

# API endpoint for document verification
@app.route("/verify_documents", methods=["POST"])
def verify_documents():
    data = request.get_json()
    documents = data.get("documents")

    # Perform document verification checks
    verification_status = {}
    for document_type, document_id in documents.items():
        if document_id == loan_application["documents"].get(document_type):
            verification_status[document_type] = "Verified"
        else:
            verification_status[document_type] = "Not Verified"

    # Update verification status in the loan application
    loan_application["verification_status"] = verification_status

    return jsonify({"message": "Document verification completed", "verification_status": verification_status})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines two API endpoints: `/loan_application/<applicant_id>` for retrieving the loan application and associated documents, and `/verify_documents` for performing document verification.

The `/loan_application/<applicant_id>` endpoint accepts a GET request with the applicant ID as a parameter and returns the loan application and associated documents if found.

The `/verify_documents` endpoint accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the documents to be verified. It performs the document verification checks and updates the verification status in the loan application.

Note that this is a simplified example and does not include all the acceptance criteria mentioned in the user story. You can modify and expand the code according to your specific requirements.
